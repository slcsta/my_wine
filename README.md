Description

Remembering wines you like as well as wines you've tried but never want to buy again can prove challening. 

As you track wines you've had, Notable Wines provides insight into your taste preferences. You may find that 
you prefer wines from a specific region or American Viticultural Area (AVA). 

The app can also help people working in the food and wine industry who need to recommend wine to customers. 
The app facilitates recs by tracking the profile of a wine along with the user's opinion of it.

Users of Notable Wines can see wines added by other users. Reviews and evaluations are accessible to all who 
have an account and are logged in.

A basic rating feature allows selection from a drop-down menu. A user can add tasting notes to describe a wine's 
profile and include information about how a wine pairs with various foods, etc.

When adding a wine, a user can identify a wine by its "ingredients" or varietal--the type of grapes used to make 
the wine. The region or AVA and vintage are included so the user can recognize the growing conditions in a region 
in a particular year.
